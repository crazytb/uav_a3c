## Failure Mode Analysis

### Individual Learning Failure Cases (Seed 789)

**Worker 3 (Individual):**
- Velocity 5: 2.28 ± 0.48
- Velocity 10: 2.55 ± 0.50
- Velocity 50: 2.88 ± 0.51
- Velocity 100: 3.25 ± 0.51

**Worker 4 (Individual):**
- Velocity 5: 5.44 ± 1.78
- Velocity 10: 5.18 ± 1.44
- Velocity 50: 2.21 ± 0.49
- Velocity 100: 1.25 ± 0.44 (catastrophic)

**Root Cause Hypothesis:**
- Individual workers converge to local optima specific to training conditions
- Lack of parameter sharing prevents learning generalizable features
- Channel dynamics variations during training lead to overfitting

### A3C Robustness Mechanisms

**Why A3C Generalizes Better:**
1. **Experience diversity:** 5 workers explore different trajectories simultaneously
2. **Parameter averaging:** Gradient updates from diverse experiences smooth out local optima
3. **Implicit regularization:** Asynchronous updates act as noise, preventing overfitting
4. **Shared representation:** Common feature extractor learns environment-invariant features

## Implications for Ablation Study

### Recommended Approach

Based on these findings, the ablation study should prioritize **generalization performance over training performance**.

**Methodology:**
1. Train ablation variants for 500-1000 episodes (sufficient for convergence)
2. Test extensively on velocity sweep (9 velocities × 100 episodes)
3. Compare generalization scores, not training scores

**Time Savings:**
- Training-based: 2000 episodes × 21 ablations = 420,000 episodes
- Generalization-based: 500 episodes × 21 ablations = 10,500 episodes + testing
- **Estimated savings: 10-20x reduction in computation time**

### Priority Ablations

**Phase 1: Network Architecture (Critical)**
1. **No RNN** (use feedforward) - Expected major generalization impact
2. **No Layer Normalization** - Expected moderate impact
3. **Hidden dimension variations** - Expected minor impact

**Phase 2: Hyperparameters (Important)**
4. **Entropy coefficient variations** - Expected exploration-exploitation tradeoff
5. **Value loss coefficient** - Expected stability impact
6. **Learning rate variations** - Expected convergence speed impact

**Phase 3: Environment Configuration (Important)**
7. **Worker count variations** - Expected diversity impact
8. **Cloud resource variations** - Expected task difficulty impact
